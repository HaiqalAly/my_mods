![Paradox Mod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paradox%20Game-CK3%20Mod-0059b3?logo=paradoxinteractive&logoColor=white)


## ℹ️ Description
A small collection of my personal Crusader Kings III mods, currently featuring custom traditions, men-at-arms, and more. These mods aren’t meant to be historically accurate neither perfectly balanced, but I'm planning to expand them over time.

## ✨ Features
- Custom traditions  
- Custom men-at-arms types  
- Custom tenets
- Custom Innovation

## 👥 Culture Affected
- Ainuic
- Balto Finnic

## 📥 Installation
### 1. Download & Extract
- Click **Code → Download ZIP**.
- Extract the ZIP.
- Inside, you’ll find:
  - **`halve.mod`**
  - **`halve_flavor`** folder

### 2. Move to CK3 Mod Folder
Place both items into: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod/` Create one if it doesn't exist.
Your structure should more or less look like this:

```text
mod/
├─ halve.mod
└─ halve_flavor/
   └─ common/
```

### 3. Enable in Launcher
- Open CK3 Launcher → **Mods**
- Add the mod to your **Playset**
- Click **Play**

Done!


Note: Files such as `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, and `README.md` are development files and should be ignored or safely deleted from the final install location. 

These are development files and **not required** for the mod to work.

## 🔧 Compatibility
- Works with the latest CK3 version  
- Should be compatible with most mods

## 📌 Planned Additions
- More traditions  
- More MAA variations  
- Additional tenets  
- New Cultural fascination (Innovations) and more

## 📝 Notes
These mods are made for personal use, it's not historically accurate and may not be mechanically balanced.  
Feel free to use or modify them however you like.
