## ℹ️ Description
A small collection of my personal Crusader Kings III mods, currently featuring custom traditions, men-at-arms, and tenets.  
These mods aren’t meant to be fully balanced or serious projects, but I'm planning to expand them over time.

## ✨ Features
- Custom traditions  
- Custom men-at-arms types  
- Custom tenets

## 📥 Installation
1. Code → Download ZIP
2. Extract and move the inner mod folder so it contains `descriptor.mod` and `common/`
3. Copy folder to: `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings III/mod/`
4. Enable mod in CK3 Launcher → Mods → Enable

Note: Files such as .gitignore, LICENSE, and README.md are development files and should be ignored or safely deleted from the final install location. 

These are development files and **not required** for the mod to work.

## 🔧 Compatibility
- Works with the latest CK3 version  
- Should be compatible with most mods that don’t modify the same traditions/MAA/tenets  

## 📌 Planned Additions
- More traditions  
- More MAA variations  
- Additional tenets  
- New Cultural fascination (Innovations) and more

## 📝 Notes
These mods are made for personal use and may not be balanced.  
Feel free to use or modify them however you like.
