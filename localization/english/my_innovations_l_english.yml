  innovation_yukar_desc:0 "For generations, the yukar heroic epics and spiritual narratives were preserved only through memory and voice. With the rise of a literate bureaucracy and a more industrious cultural order, these ancient stories are finally codified in a newly formalized writing system. Their preservation strengthens administration, unifies identity, and accelerates the spread of knowledge throughout the realm."
